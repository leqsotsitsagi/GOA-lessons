<!-- The tags `<b></b>` and `<br>` are HTML tags used to format text in web pages:

1. `<b></b>`:
   - This tag is used to make text bold.
   - Anything wrapped within `<b>` and `</b>` tags will appear in bold font on the webpage.
   - Example: `<b>This text is bold</b>` will display as **This text is bold**.

2. `<br>`:
   - This tag is used to insert a line break in the text.
   - It doesn't have a closing tag.
   - When encountered, it forces the text following it to start on a new line.

These tags are fundamental for basic text formatting and layout in HTML documents.

for exlample lets compare <p></p> to <b></b> and we will see it ourselves
 -->

<p>Hello world</p>
<b>Hello world</b>

<!-- and now lets see what <br> does -->

 <p>Hello<br>World</p>

<!-- as we can see now we have two lines where first says "Hello" and second line says "World"
even tho those words are in single line of code -->
